# stack_overflow_analysis
This project explores the demographics, earnings, and learning journeys of contributors. Beyond Stack Overflow\'s own analysis, this endeavor provides a unique perspective, enriching our understanding of the global coding community.

A R shiny project:
Data source: Kaggle, 2022 Stack Overflow Annual Survey

Questions to explore:
1. Who are those respondants?
2. How does background effect salary (education, age, gender & years of experience)?
3. How developers learn how to code (physical vs online)?
4. What is the most popular and high paying technology?

Steps:
1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning (Difficulty: As the data is human generated (questionnaire), the format is inconsistent)
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data visualisation

Data visualisation:
Who are those respondants?
